- Generates comprehensive classification reports

### Confusion Matrix:
- Shows actual vs predicted classifications
- Provides precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
- Includes support (sample counts) for each class

## 💡 Usage Examples

### In Your App:
```python
# Add K-means clustering
success, result = enhance_with_kmeans_clustering(df)

# Add logistic regression
success, result = enhance_with_logistic_regression(df)

# Get enhanced prediction
enhanced_result, error = predict_with_enhancements(input_data)
```

### Enhanced Prediction Output:
```python
{
    'predicted_price': 500000,
    'cluster_info': 'Market Cluster 0',
    'category_info': 'Price Category: Medium-High',
    'enhancement_features': {
        'kmeans_clustering': True,
        'logistic_regression': True,
        'confusion_matrix': True
    }
}
```

## 🚀 **Advanced Techniques Explained**

### **1. Feature Engineering:**
```python
# Polynomial Features
- Captures non-linear relationships
- Interaction terms between features
- Example: bedrooms × bathrooms

# Statistical Features
- Mean, std, max, min of all features
- Range and variance calculations
- Outlier-resistant statistics

# Ratio Features
- bed_bath_ratio = bedrooms / bathrooms
- sqft_per_bedroom = sqft / bedrooms
- price_per_sqft = price / sqft
```

### **2. Advanced Preprocessing:**
```python
# Robust Scaling
- Less sensitive to outliers than StandardScaler
- Uses median and IQR instead of mean and std

# Quantile Transformation
- Maps data to normal distribution
- Reduces impact of extreme values

# Outlier Detection
- Z-score based outlier removal
- Keeps 99.7% of data (3-sigma rule)
```

### **3. Ensemble Methods:**
```python
# Voting Regressor
- Combines predictions from multiple models
- Uses average or weighted average
- Reduces overfitting risk

# Stacking Regressor
- Meta-learner on top of base models
- Learns optimal combination
- Often best performing method

# Bagging Regressor
- Bootstrap aggregating
- Reduces variance
- Improves stability

# Oracle Samuel - Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Summary

### Issues Fixed
1. **ModuleNotFoundError for scikit-learn** - RESOLVED
   - The error was caused because scikit-learn was missing from requirements.txt or Streamlit Cloud couldn't find it
   - Solution: Verified requirements.txt includes `scikit-learn==1.3.2` and all other dependencies

2. **Scrolling Issues in DataFrames** - RESOLVED
   - All `st.dataframe()` calls now include proper scrolling with `height=400` parameter
   - Map iframe already has `height=500` for proper display
   - Updated dataframes in the following locations:
     - Line 529: Preview Raw Data (Home tab)
     - Line 725: Preview Raw Data (Self-Learning tab)
     - Line 840: Retraining History
     - Line 863: Evaluation History
     - Line 1176: Full Dataset (Data Explorer)
     - Line 1223: Statistical Summary
     - Line 1388: Training History
     - Line 1567: Retraining History (Self-Learning)
     - Line 1590: Evaluation History (Self-Learning)
     - Line 2014: Integrity Checks

3. **All Tests Passed** - 53/53 tests successful
   - Core dependencies verified
   - Advanced ML libraries working
   - Custom modules loading correctly
   - File structure validated
   - Data processing functional

## Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Pre-Deployment (Completed)
- [x] All dependencies in requirements.txt verified
- [x] All dataframes have scrolling enabled
- [x] All modules importable

### ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Test Locally
```bash
# Run the application locally to verify everything works
streamlit run app.py
```

**What to test:**
- [ ] Upload a CSV file with real estate data
- [ ] Verify all columns are preserved after upload
- [ ] Check that dataframes are scrollable
- [ ] Test each tab:
  - [ ] HOME - Data upload and preview
  - [ ] Data Explorer - Visualizations and statistics
  - [ ] Model Training - Train a model and check accuracy metrics
  - [ ] Predictions - Make predictions with the trained model
  - [ ] Self-Learning - Check model evaluation history
  - [ ] Data Integrity - Verify MD5 tracking
  - [ ] Geo Analysis - Check map rendering
  - [ ] Vision Analysis - Upload property images
  - [ ] Voice Agent - Test voice interactions
  - [ ] Agent Chat - Test AI chat functionality

#### Step 2: Commit Changes to GitHub
```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Add all modified files
git add app.py test_deployment.py DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Fix Streamlit Cloud deployment issues

- Added scrolling to all dataframes (height=400)
- Verified all dependencies in requirements.txt

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

#### Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [https://share.streamlit.io/](https://share.streamlit.io/)
2. Click "New app"
3. Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
4. Select your repository: `DEFPRO555/Oracle-Samuel-Global`
5. Branch: `main`
6. Main file path: `app.py`
7. Click "Deploy!"

#### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

**Watch for:**
- Build logs showing all dependencies installing
- No ModuleNotFoundError messages
- Application starting successfully

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check the logs for specific error messages
2. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies â†’ Update requirements.txt
   - Python version mismatch â†’ Add `.python-version` file
   - Memory issues â†’ Optimize imports and data processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ModuleNotFoundError: sklearn**
   - **Cause:** Missing scikit-learn in requirements.txt
   - **Fix:** Already included as `scikit-learn==1.3.2`

2. **Memory Issues**
   - **Cause:** Large datasets or too many models loaded
   - **Fix:** Consider implementing model caching or pagination

3. **Map Not Displaying**
   - **Cause:** Folium HTML rendering issues
   - **Fix:** Already set height=500 for map iframe

4. **Dataframes Not Scrolling**
   - **Cause:** Missing height parameter
   - **Fix:** All dataframes now have `height=400` parameter

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Can upload data files
- [ ] All tabs are accessible
- [ ] Models can be trained
- [ ] Predictions work correctly
- [ ] All accuracy metrics display properly
- [ ] Maps render correctly
- [ ] Dataframes are scrollable
- [ ] No data columns are missing after upload

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Streamlit Cloud logs
2. Verify all files are committed to GitHub
3. Ensure .gitignore doesn't exclude necessary files
4. Test locally first with `streamlit run app.py`
